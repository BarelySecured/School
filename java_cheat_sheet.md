# Testing
## This is a test, I am trying to get familiar with git, github
## 2nd time create this to make a cheat sheet for learning java

Simple java  code template:

public class HelloWorld {
# HelloWorld is the file name
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Say something please");
# System is a built-in Java class that contains useful tools
    }
}


syntax is the specific instructions which java understands
semicolons are used to mark the end of a statement
# What is a compiled  programming language?
code written in java file  is transformed into byte  code  by a  compiler before it is executed by the JVM on computer.

a compiler is a program that translate human-friendly programming language into  other programming languages that computers can execute.
